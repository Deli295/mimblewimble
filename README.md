# Mimblewimble - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone for the PlayStation 2

Inspired by DeXiaZ's Langlock Mod, this patch implements the same features as the mentioned hack, meaning Harry will no longer say the flavour of the beans each time he picks one up. The only difference between both mods is that this one is compatible with the versions of the game that match the redump database.

## Instructions
This patch works for the North American, European and Asian versions of the game. Pick the one that corresponds to your copy. Use xdelta to patch your game backup.
